### Inititial Notes:
I whoul say that I am here at school to learn and in some ways that is the case but in many cases the school curiculum is esentialy focused on prepearing students for the test and not actualy exploring the topics fully. The perpose the the school is to teach us but because of standerdized testing that esentialy means students dont get much time to explore there interest yet are still presured to know what there pasion is and what they will go to collage for even as early as 8th grade. I mean I know that I specificaly want to go into ML and Comp Sci but I am very much part of the minority of people who just happend to find there interest (no thanks to the education system). I feal that I am still able to learn and stay interested at school. last year i mostly just coasted due to sleep deprevation but I am hoping that this year I can actualy learn.

### Activity
#### Education Video
before school became compulsery mainly rich white males whould go to school unlike many kids from rural comunities. I do think that making school compulsury evens the playing feald. I asume the law was changed in an attempt to provide education to everyone despite economic status. as an effect this hopefully whould allow people even from rural or poorer backgrounds to be able to get a higher paying job that required an education.

#### The Future of Work
The video mostly focuses on automation and its effect on society. I beleave that the advant of modern generative AI could lead to a drastic shift in how student learn. While I hope that human teachers are never replaced I whould like to see the intruduction of AI assistant that could help students grasp complex consepts on an individual level in the case of a student stuguling instead of the teacher needing to assist on a student by student basis. this whould alow students to get help on an indiviual basis while even geting responses at home. with the increasing use of chatbots such as chatGPT, or claud sonnet by students I hope that these tools are treated in a mindfull and educational manor. My hope is that AI is used to teach consepts instead of generating full answers to problems. the Issue is even modern generatve NLP models strugle with supling 100% factual responses. while many issues in this case can be negated or minimize factualy incorect answers such as RAG (retreavle augmented generation) which essentialy provides a corpus of data for the LLM to refernce when responding to prompts. while many work around have reduced the issue it still AI as we know it remains a unreliable technology and lacks many resasoning or problem solving skills that whould be nessisary to fufill the role of a tutor.

lets talk about AlphaProof and AlphaZero
many of the problems related to LLM relates to there inahability to dicern truth from fiction in many cases. as models have got larger and more efficient LLMs have gotten better at disserning truth and reasoning as there understanding of the world or "world model" has got more factual. but even with the encouraging trend of these models in benchmarks they still face these shorcomings. recent models that score amazingingly on these benchmarks are in many ways deseptive as when taking the same benchmark but with the answer choises rearanged the models preformed significantly worse which should not hapen if the reason for the models increased score was reasoning alone.
thus entering the picture is AlphaProof. the AlphaProof model from the Google DeepMind team is a remarcable new model that aplies a similer stratagy to problem solving to the fammose AlphaZero  and its variations that succseaded in defeating the Go world champion back in 2016. google has recently mentioned that they want to apply some of the same techniques used in alphaProof on gemini which whould hopfuly unlock some the that problem solving capabilities that even the frontier models are lacking
